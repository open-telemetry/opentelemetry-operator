  Starting with this release, the OpenTelemetry Operator now enables multi-instrumentation by default.
  This enhancement allows instrumentation of multiple containers in a pod with language-specific configurations.|
  Key Changes:
    - Single Instrumentation (Default Behavior): If no container names are specified using the
      `instrumentation.opentelemetry.io/container-names` annotation, instrumentation will be applied to the first container in
      the pod spec by default. This only applies when single instrumentation injection is configured.
    - Multi-Container Pods: In scenarios where different containers in a pod use distinct technologies, users must specify the
      container(s) for instrumentation using language-specific annotations. Without this specification, the default behavior may
      not work as expected for multi-container environments.
  Compatibility:
    - Users already utilizing the `instrumentation.opentelemetry.io/container-names` annotation do not need to take any action.
      Their existing setup will continue to function as before.
    - Important: Users who attempt to configure both `instrumentation.opentelemetry.io/container-names` and language-specific annotations
      (for multi-instrumentation) simultaneously will encounter an error, as this configuration is not supported.
