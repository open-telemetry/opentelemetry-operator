  The new utility is available as part of a new container image.

  To use the image in a running OpenShift cluster, you need to run the following command:

  ```sh
  oc adm must-gather --image=ghcr.io/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-operator/must-gather -- /usr/bin/must-gather --operator-namespace opentelemetry-operator-system
  ```
