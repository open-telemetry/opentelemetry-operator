  This patch improves container port collisions when the user defines additional ports in the CR.

  When ports are specified in the CR:
  - If a port number from the CR matches a port inferred from the config, the inferred port is removed
  - If a port name from the CR matches an inferred port name, the inferred port is renamed to "port-{number}"
