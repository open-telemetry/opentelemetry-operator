  `service.instance.id` is expected to be `<namespace>.<podName>.<containerName>`
  
  But while pod is created it may not have the `podName` yet at the podMutator webhooks.
  
  This changed to use the env var `OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES_POD_NAME` which will be present at runtime.
  `<namespace>.$(OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES_POD_NAME).<containerName>`
  
  Making a valid and complete value for `service.instance.id` to be added.
