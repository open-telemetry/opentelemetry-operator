  The batch processor is being deprecated in the OpenTelemetry Collector project.
  A warning event is now emitted when an OpenTelemetryCollector CR uses the batch processor,
  directing users to migrate to alternative batching solutions.
  See https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/issues/12022 for more details.
