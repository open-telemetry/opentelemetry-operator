change_type: enhancement

# The name of the component, or a single word describing the area of concern, (e.g. collector, target allocator, auto-instrumentation, opamp, github action)
component: collector

# A brief description of the change. Surround your text with quotes ("") if it needs to start with a backtick (`).
note: Ensure the collector container is always listed first in the podspec

# One or more tracking issues related to the change
issues: [4548]

# (Optional) One or more lines of additional information to render under the primary note.
# These lines will be padded with 2 spaces and then inserted directly into the document.
# Use pipe (|) for multiline entries.
subtext: This is so tools like kubectx logs will always default to the collector container instead of any additional containers that are configured.
