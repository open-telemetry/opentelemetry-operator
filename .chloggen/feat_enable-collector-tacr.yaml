  As a result of this change, when the target allocator section is enabled in the Collector CR, 
  this now creates a TargetAllocator CR instead of generating the manifests directly. Behavior should otherwise be
  unchanged. You can go back to the previous behaviour by passing the 
  `--feature-gates=-operator.collector.targetallocatorcr` command-line option to the operator.
