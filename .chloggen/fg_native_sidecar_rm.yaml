  The feature gate `operator.sidecarcontainers.native` has been removed.
  It was introduced in v0.111.0, enabled by default since v0.132.0, and marked as stable in v0.139.0.
  Native sidecars are now automatically enabled on Kubernetes v1.29+ without requiring a feature gate.
  If you were explicitly enabling or disabling this feature gate with `--feature-gates=+operator.sidecarcontainers.native`,
  you must remove that flag.
