  Finalizer usage was restricted to cluster scoped resources only. Namespaced resources no longer receive finalizers,
  preventing blocked namespace deletion if the operator is removed first. The change aligns finalizer behavior with
  cluster-level RBAC availability, ensuring finalizers are applied only when the operator has the required
  cluster scoped permissions.
