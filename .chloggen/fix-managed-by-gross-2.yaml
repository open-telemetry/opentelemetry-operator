  This PR removes the restriction on the operator to only upgrade manually applied CRDs. This meant
  that resources applied by helm were not upgraded at all. The solution was to remove the restriction
  we had on querying the label app.kubernetes.io/managed-by=opentelemetry-operator, thereby upgrading
  ALL CRDs in the cluster.
