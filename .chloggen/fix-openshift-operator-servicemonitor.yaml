  Two issues prevented the operator ServiceMonitor from being created on OpenShift:
  1. The OpenShift kustomize patches were incorrectly overwriting operator args, removing flags like `--create-sm-operator-metrics=true`.
  2. The prometheus-operator library `SchemeHTTPS` constant uses uppercase "HTTPS" which is rejected by ServiceMonitor CRD validation.
