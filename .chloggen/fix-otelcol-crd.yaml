  This change makes `spec.config.service.pipelines.processors` in `OpenTelemetryCollector` CRD optional, aligning with OTel Collector best practices. It resolves deletion issues by providing flexibility in CRD configuration, addressing conflicts between strict validation and practical uses.
  Note: Updating the `opentelemetrycollectors.opentelemetry.io` CRD resource is required.
