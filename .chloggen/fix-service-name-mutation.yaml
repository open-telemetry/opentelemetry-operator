  The Operator 0.129.1 introduced a new feature which allows setting the serviceName of the collector statefulset ([#4041](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-operator/pull/4041)).
  This feature introduced two issues:
  1. upgrade failure because the default stateful serviceName changed
  2. the statefulset serviceName field is mutable, therefore a change of the collector serviceName field is not applied
