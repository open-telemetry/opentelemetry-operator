  The Target Allocator now automatically reloads TLS certificates when they are renewed
  by cert-manager. Previously, certificate renewals required a pod restart because
  certificates were only loaded once at startup. The fix uses fsnotify to watch the
  certificate directory and dynamically reloads certificates via the GetCertificate
  callback, enabling seamless certificate rotation without downtime.
