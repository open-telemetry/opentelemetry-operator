  On clusters with global proxy the collector might fail to talk to target allocator
  because the endpoint is set to `<ta-service-name>:port` and therefore it will go to proxy
  and request might be forwarded to internet. Clusters with proxy configure `NO_PROXY` to `.svc.cluster.local` so 
  the calls to this endpoint will not go through the proxy.
