  When the collector connects to the target allocator over mTLS, certificates were not automatically reloaded after expiration. This adds reload_interval to the TLS configuration, enabling the Prometheus receiver to periodically reload certificates from disk.

  The default interval of 5 minutes provides a good balance between picking up renewed certificates promptly and avoiding unnecessary overhead.
