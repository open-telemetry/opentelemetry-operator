  Now Instrumentation CR supports specifying TLS certificates for exporter:
  ```yaml
  spec:
    exporter:
      endpoint: https://otel-collector:4317
      tls:
        secretName: otel-tls-certs
        configMapName: otel-ca-bundle
        # otel-ca-bundle
        ca_file: ca.crt
        # present in otel-tls-certs
        cert_file: tls.crt 
        # present in otel-tls-certs
        key_file: tls.key
  ```
  
  * Propagating secrets across namespaces can be done with https://github.com/EmberStack/kubernetes-reflector or https://github.com/zakkg3/ClusterSecret
  * Restarting workloads on certificate renewal can be done with https://github.com/stakater/Reloader or https://github.com/wave-k8s/wave
