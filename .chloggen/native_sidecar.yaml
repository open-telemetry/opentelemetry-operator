  Native sidecars are supported since Kubernetes version `1.28` and are availabe by default since `1.29`.
  To use native sidecars on Kubernetes v1.28 make sure the "SidecarContainers" feature gate on kubernetes is enabled.
  If native sidecars are available, the operator can be advised to use them by adding adding
  the `--feature-gates=operator.sidecarcontainers.native` to the Operator args.
  In the future this may will become availabe as deployment mode on the Collector CR. See [#3356](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-operator/issues/3356)
