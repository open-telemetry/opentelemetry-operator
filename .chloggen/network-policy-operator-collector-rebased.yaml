  This change adds a network policy to the collector to allow traffic to all collector receivers and egress traffic from the collector pod.
  The collector network policy can be enabled in the collector CR.
  ```yaml
  spec:
    networkPolicy:
      enabled: true
  ```
  By default it is disabled, however the default value is configured with a feature gate `--feature-gates=collector.networkpolicy`.
  The feature gate will be enabled in the future releases.
