  This change adds a network policy to the target allocator which allows traffic to the port `8080` and outgoing traffic to the API server.
  The target allocator network policy can be enabled in the target allocator CR.
  ```yaml
  spec:
    networkPolicy:
      enabled: true
  ```
  By default it is disabled, however the default value is configured with a feature gate `--feature-gates=operand.networkpolicy`.
  The feature gate will be enabled in the future releases.
