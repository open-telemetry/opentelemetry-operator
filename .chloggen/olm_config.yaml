  The default configuration in the OLM bundle has been changed from command-line arguments to environment variables,
  making it easily overwritable when deployed using OLM's Subscription config. Command-line flags continue to work.
  All Config struct fields now support environment variable configuration.

  Configuration set via the Subscription's config section will persist and be reapplied after operator upgrades.

  Example of overriding configuration via OLM Subscription:

  ```yaml
  apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
  kind: Subscription
  metadata:
    name: opentelemetry-operator
  spec:
    channel: stable
    name: opentelemetry-operator
    source: operatorhubio-catalog
    sourceNamespace: olm
    config:
      env:
      - name: FEATURE_GATES
        value: "operator.networkpolicy,operand.networkpolicy"
      - name: ENABLE_GO_AUTO_INSTRUMENTATION
        value: "true"
      - name: METRICS_SECURE
        value: "false"
  ```
