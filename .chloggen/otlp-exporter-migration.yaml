  The operator now automatically renames deprecated otlp and otlphttp exporters to otlp_grpc and otlp_http when upgrading to collector v0.145.0+.
  Deprecation warnings are emitted for existing configs using old names to help users migrate their configurations.
  This change aligns with the OpenTelemetry Collector's deprecation of generic OTLP exporter names in favor of explicit protocol names.
