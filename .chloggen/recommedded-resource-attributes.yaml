  This change updates the recommended resource attributes to match the [semantic conventions](https://github.com/open-telemetry/semantic-conventions/blob/main/docs/non-normative/k8s-attributes.md).
  The following attributes have been updated:
  - `service.version` now uses the docker image digest in addition to the tag
  - the well-known label `app.kubernetes.io/part-of` has been removed
  - the well-known label `app.kubernetes.io/instance` has been added (translates to `service.name`)
