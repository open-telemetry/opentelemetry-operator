  The operator now uses controller-runtime built-in auth for the metrics server. It is disabled by default.
  The client accessing the metrics endpoint must have the following RBAC rule `nonResourceURLs: "/metrics", verbs: get`.
  Which didn't change from the previous approach of using kube-rbac-proxy.
  
  This changes adds following flags to the operator:
  `metrics-secure` - enables authentication and authorization for the metrics server. If no TLS certificates are provided, self signed certificates will be generated.
  `metrics-tls-cert-file` - TLS certificate file for the metrics server
  `metrics-tls-key-file` - TLS private key file for the metrics server
  
  This change changes the following flags on the operator:
  `--metrics-addr` - changes from `127.0.0.1:8080` to `:8443` which matches the operator's metrics service port.
