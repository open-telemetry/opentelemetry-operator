change_type: breaking

component: auto-instrumentation

note: Add support for k8s labels such as app.kubernetes.io/name and annotations for resource attributes

issues: [3112]

subtext: |
  It's a breaking change because these annotations are well-known and widely used in the Kubernetes ecosystem. The following labels are supported:
    - `app.kubernetes.io/name` becomes `service.name`
    - `app.kubernetes.io/version` becomes `service.version`
    - `app.kubernetes.io/part-of` becomes `service.namespace`
    - `app.kubernetes.io/instance` becomes `service.instance.id`
