  Technically, this is a breaking change, but we regard it as a bug fix because the previous behavior was incorrect.
  
  In you did have multiple containers and use `app.kubernetes.io/instance` to set the `service.instance.id`, 
  you will now see multiple instances in the UI - which is the correct behavior.
  
  You can still use the attribute `resource.opentelemetry.io/service.instance.id` to set the `service.instance.id`,
  which will be shared across all containers in the pod - but this is not recommended.
  
  Refer to the [semantic conventions](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/resource/#service-experimental) 
  for more information.
