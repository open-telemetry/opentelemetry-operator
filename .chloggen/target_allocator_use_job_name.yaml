component: least-weighted target allocator strategy

# A brief description of the change. Surround your text with quotes ("") if it needs to start with a backtick (`).
note: With this change, the least-weighted target allocation strategy
will use job name instead of "first match" to break target count
ties. This way, collector targets from the same job will be spread
across collectors.
