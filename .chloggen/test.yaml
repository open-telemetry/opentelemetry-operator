  This change provides an initial implementation of the Cluster Observability CRD and operator control loop.
  Reconcilation is disabled by default.
  Currently, the CRD is **not** included in the operator bundle and must be installed manually.
  To enable reconciliation, enable the `--feature-gates=+operator.clusterobservability` feature gate.
