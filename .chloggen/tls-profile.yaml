  Added operator flag `--tls-cluster-profile` which obtains the TLS min version and cipher suites from the OpenShift `APIServer` `cluster` custom resource (CR).
  It overrides the `--tls-min-version` and `--tls-cipher-suites` flags if set.
  The flags is disabled by default on Kubernetes and enabled on OpenShift.
  
  Added operator flag `--tls-configure-operands` which configures operands TLS settings (min version, cipher suites)
  based on the supplied operator TLS flags (`--tls-cipher-suites` and `--tls-min-version`) or from the OpenShift `APIServer` CR
  if `--tls-cluster-profile` is enabled.
  The flag is disabled by default on Kubernetes and enabled on OpenShift.
  
  The `--tls-min-version` defaults to `TLSv1.2` which matches the collector's default.
  The `--tls-cipher-suites` is empty by default which matches the collector's default.
  Therefore enabling `--tls-configure-operands` with the default TLS flags should not change the collector's behavior.
