# To build one auto-instrumentation image for dotnet, please:
#  - Download your dotnet auto-instrumentation artefacts to `/autoinstrumentation` directory. This is required as when instrumenting the pod,
#    one init container will be created to copy the files to your app's container.
#  - Grant the necessary access to the files in the `/autoinstrumentation` directory.
#  - Following environment variables are injected to the application container to enable the auto-instrumentation.
#    DOTNET_ADDITIONAL_DEPS=%InstallationLocation%/AdditionalDeps
#    DOTNET_SHARED_STORE=%InstallationLocation%/store
#    DOTNET_STARTUP_HOOKS=%InstallationLocation%/netcoreapp3.1/OpenTelemetry.AutoInstrumentation.StartupHook.dll
