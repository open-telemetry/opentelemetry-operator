# Target Allocator

The TargetAllocator is an optional separately deployed component of an OpenTelemetry Collector setup, which is used to
distribute targets of the PrometheusReceiver on all deployed Collector instances.

# Design

If the Allocator is activated, all Prometheus configurations will be transferred in a separate ConfigMap which get in
turn mounted to the Allocator.    
This configuration will be resolved to target configurations and then split across all OpenTelemetryCollector instances.

TargetAllocators expose the results as [HTTP_SD endpoints](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/http_sd/)
split by collector.

#### Endpoints
`/jobs`:

```json
{
  "job1": {
    "_link": "/jobs/job1/targets"
  },
  "job2": {
    "_link": "/jobs/job1/targets"
  }
}

```

`/jobs/{jobID}/targets`:

```json
{
  "collector-1": {
    "_link": "/jobs/job1/targets?collector_id=collector-1",
    "targets": [
      {
        "Targets": [
          "10.100.100.100",
          "10.100.100.101",
          "10.100.100.102"
        ],
        "Labels": {
          "namespace": "a_namespace",
          "pod": "a_pod"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

`/jobs/{jobID}/targets?collector_id={collectorID}`:

```json
[
  {
    "targets": [
      "10.100.100.100",
      "10.100.100.101",
      "10.100.100.102"
    ],
    "labels": {
      "namespace": "a_namespace",
      "pod": "a_pod"
    }
  }
]
```


## Packages
### Watchers
Watchers are responsible for the translation of external sources into Prometheus readable scrape configurations and 
triggers updates to the DiscoveryManager

### DiscoveryManager
Watches the Prometheus service discovery for new targets and sets targets to the Allocator 

### Allocator
Shards the received targets based on the discovered Collector instances

### Collector
Client to watch for deployed Collector instances which will then provided to the Allocator.
