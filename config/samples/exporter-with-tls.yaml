# this example shows how to connect an OpenTelemetry Collector with a Jaeger instance in OpenShift,
# which is provisioned using TLS automatically. We use the inject-cabundle in the config map to
# get access to the CA that signed the certs, and tell the operator to mount the config map into the
# provisioned deployments and daemonsets
