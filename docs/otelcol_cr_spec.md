# OpenTelemetryCollector Custom Resource Specification

The below `OpenTelemetryCollector` custom resource contains all the specification that can be configured. 

```yaml
apiVersion: opentelemetry.io/v1alpha1
kind: OpenTelemetryCollector
metadata:
  name: example-collector
spec:
  // +optional Mode represents how the collector should be deployed (deployment, daemonset, statefulset or sidecar)
  mode: ""
  
  // +required Config is the raw JSON to be used as the collector's configuration. Refer to the OpenTelemetry Collector documentation for details.

  // +optional Args is the set of arguments to pass to the OpenTelemetry Collector binary
  args:
    metrics-level: detailed
  
  // +optional Replicas is the number of pod instances for the underlying OpenTelemetry Collector
  replicas: 1
  
  // +optional Image indicates the container image to use for the OpenTelemetry Collector.
  image: ""

  // +optional ImagePullPolicy indicates what image pull policy to be used to retrieve the container image to use for the OpenTelemetry Collector.
  imagePullPolicy: ""
  
  // +optional ServiceAccount indicates the name of an existing service account to use with this instance.
  serviceAccount: ""
  
  // +optional VolumeClaimTemplates will provide stable storage using PersistentVolumes. Only available when the mode=statefulset.

  // +optional VolumeMounts represents the mount points to use in the underlying collector deployment(s)
  volumeMounts: []
  
  // +optional Volumes represents which volumes to use in the underlying collector deployment(s).
  volumes: []
  
  // +optional Ports allows a set of ports to be exposed by the underlying v1.Service. By default, the operator
  // will attempt to infer the required ports by parsing the .Spec.Config property but this property can be
  // used to open aditional ports that can't be inferred by the operator, like for custom receivers.
  ports: []
  
  // +optional ENV vars to set on the OpenTelemetry Collector's Pods. These can then in certain cases be
  // consumed in the config file for the Collector.
  env: []
  
  // +optional List of sources to populate environment variables on the OpenTelemetry Collector's Pods.
  // These can then in certain cases be consumed in the config file for the Collector.

  // +optional Resources to set on the OpenTelemetry Collector pods.

  // +optional SecurityContext will be set as the container security context.
  securityContext: {}

  // +optional HostNetwork indicates if the pod should run in the host networking namespace.
  hostNetwork: false
  
  // +optional Toleration to schedule OpenTelemetry Collector pods.
  // This is only relevant to daemonsets, statefulsets and deployments
