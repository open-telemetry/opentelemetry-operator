# This KUTTL assert uses the check-daemonset.sh script to ensure the number of ready pods in a daemonset matches the desired count, retrying until successful or a timeout occurs. The script is needed as the number of Kubernetes cluster nodes can vary and we cannot statically set desiredNumberScheduled and numberReady in the assert for daemonset status.
